Polynum
Polynum multiplication using FFT will be "fast_mul"
	1. implement FFT over a vector
	2. implement FFT^-1 over a vector.
	3. implement convolution over two vectors
	4. implement correlation (expand data so convolution won't be cyclic)

	*** SHOULD BE WRITTEN GENERICLY so FFT function shouldn't care if working under RING of Integers Mod P or Complex Numbers.

Polynum ** 2 (multiplcation)
Polynum * c (where c is an Integer)
BigIntegers (mod P)
P is ~ 1,073,750,017
g = 5
omega = 381,780,781 # omega = g**(p-1)/1024
omega SHOULD BE POWER OF TWO to ease calculations

X miller-rabin (For other p)
X inv_mod (mod P) # BigInt should support % and /
